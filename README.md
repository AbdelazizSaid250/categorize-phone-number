<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a single page using Java and Spring framework with thymeleaf which uses a SQLite database.

The database has Customer table which contains:
* id (0)
* name ("Abdelaziz Said")
* phone ("(212) 698054317")

I need to Categorize this phone number by:
* Country Name
* State (The Number is Valid or not. So if it's true that mean the number is valid, and if not which means that the number doesn't related to this country)
* Country Code
* Phone Number



## Steps to Use the Project
1. Install the SQLite into your localhost.
2. Add dummy data into customer table.
3. Open the browser into this url [https://localhost:8080/customer/categorize/](https://localhost:8080/customer/categorize/)


This will show you the Required Page which contains a table with:
* Country Name
* State
* Country Code
* Phone Number
